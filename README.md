Full workflow automation for qPCR and getting all of what is needed for a small lab to save money when ordering materials

Contains 2 external repos:
1: primerPlus, a primer and gblock designer. Primer design is done with primer3, with constraints incrimentally
relaxed to find best pairs with their heuristic scores. gblock design planned to be using NUPACK.
